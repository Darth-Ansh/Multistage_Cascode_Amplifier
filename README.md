# Multistage_Cascode_Amplifier
Designed and analysed the schematic and layout for cascode amplifier, beta multiplier, and cascode current mirror using
LTspice and Magic software.
Evaluated amplifierâ€™s performance across different technology nodes (180 nm with 1.8 V supply and 22 nm with 0.8 V
supply) for studying the effects of scaling down on circuit specifications.
